# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish 
to make via issue, [our support Discord](https://discord.gg/fmbot), or any other 
method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

If you make a useful pull request you will also get the contributor status in the 
publicly hosted bot.

## Release process

1. When a new change is made, please create a PR for the dev branch.
2. The change will be tested on the develop version of the bot and if everything 
goes smoothly it will be released onto the main bot and merged to master.

Note: Since most of the time only 1 developer is working on the bot changes get 
committed directly to the 'dev' branch. If more developers are willing to help 
with this project, there will probably a more strict contributing guideline.
